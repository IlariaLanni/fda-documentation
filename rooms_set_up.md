#**Rooms Set Up**   

Setting up your rooms on your Frontdesk Anywhere is a good way to start building your account and make it look as familiar as your hotel. This operation involves not only creating rooms, but also building amentities, define the levels you wish to have rooms organize, load pictures and much more.   
In the sections below you will learn the best ways to create your hotel room structure.

##**1. Floors**  

Let's start by set up the number of floors in your property. This is important as you will be able to group your rooms by the floor they are on!  

 - In the Admin Settings, click on the link **Floors** under section _Property Info_:

 - You will see that two floors are already created by default. Click on the blue button _Add a Floor_ to add more floors; a small pop-up window will prompt you to place the name of the new floor:

##**1. Amenities**

Let's start by creating the amenities that are available in your rooms. Make sure to create all of the amenities, independently of the type or room level in which they appear.   

  - In the Admin Settings, click on the link **Room Amenities**:

  - You will see a list of some defaulted amenities.

  - Before creating new ones, you can first edit those that you do not need, as this will make your account cleaner. For example, if you do not offer a laundry service in any of the rooms, but you offer a complimentary bathrobe, you will need to edit the laundry service and turn it into a bathrobe. To do this, click on the blue link _Edit_ on the corresponding row:

  - Edit the name in the _Amenity Title_ field, and click on the **Save** button when done.

  - To add a new amenity, click on the blue button **Add a New Amenity**: the procedure is the same as editing an amenity.
