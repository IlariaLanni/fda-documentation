#**Rooms Set Up**   

Setting up your rooms on your Frontdesk Anywhere is a good way to start building your account and make it look as familiar as your hotel. This operation involves not only creating rooms, but also building amentities, define the levels you wish to have rooms organize, load pictures and much more.   
In the sections below you will learn the best ways to create your hotel room structure.

##**1. Floors**  

Let's start by set up the number of floors in your property. This is important as you will be able to group your rooms by the floor they are on!  

 - In the Admin Settings, click on the link **Floors** under section _Property Info_:

 - You will see that two floors are already created by default. Click on the blue button _Add a Floor_ to add more floors; a small pop-up window will prompt you to place the name of the new floor:

 Click on the blue button _Save_ when done.  
 NOTE: you can either number your floors (1,2,3, etc.) or name them (First, Second, etc).  
 
###**Floor Operations**   

 - **EDIT**: To edit a floor, click on the blue link _Edit_ in the relevant row:

The same small window will pop-up: edit the name and click on the button _Save_ when done.  

 - **DEACTIVATE**: To deactivate a floor, uncheck the box under the column _Status_ for the relevant row:

- **DELETE**: Select the floor you want to delete by checking the check-box on the left hand side of the relevant row, and click _Delete Selected Floor_:

- **HOW TO USE FLOORS**: When you log in into your account, go to the Frontdesk Tab: on the right hand side there will be a scroll down menu with the tag _View by Type_. Click on the scroll down menu and select _View by Floor_ in order to have your rooms grouped by floors.

##**2. Amenities**

Let's start by creating the amenities that are available in your rooms. Make sure to create all of the amenities, independently of the type or room level in which they appear.   

  - In the Admin Settings, click on the link **Room Amenities**:
  
  ![](1.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/1.png)  
  
  - You will see a list of some defaulted amenities.
 
   ![](2.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/2.png)
  
  - Before creating new ones, you can first edit those that you do not need, as this will make your account cleaner. For example, if you do not offer a laundry service in any of the rooms, but you offer a complimentary bathrobe, you will need to edit the laundry service and turn it into a bathrobe. To do this, click on the blue link _Edit_ on the corresponding row:
  
  ![](4.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/4.png)
    
  - Edit the name in the _Amenity Title_ field, and click on the **Save** button when done.
  
  ![](5.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/5.png)
  
  - To add a new amenity, click on the blue button **Add a New Amenity**: the procedure is the same as editing an amenity.

  - To deactivate an amenity, uncheck the box under the column _Status_, corresponding to the relevant row:

##**3. Room Classes**

A room class is a general concept referring to any extra organisazional level you wish to have for your rooms. For example, if your hotel offers bed dorms, you can create a 'dorm' class to group your beds; or if you have different buildings, you can treat classes as buildings and easily check for availability.  
**Note**: a class is different from a room _type_. If you do not need classes and types suffice, then you can skip to the section Room Types

 - Start by clicking on the link _Room Classes_ in the Admin Settings:  
 
 ![](16.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/16.png)

 - You can create a new class by clicking on the blue button _Add a Class_ and a small window will pop up: type in the name of the class you wish to create and click on the blue button _Save_

 ###**Room Classes Operations**   

 - **EDIT**: to edit a class, click on the blue button _Edit_ on the right hand side of the class you wish to amend:  
 
 ![](19.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/19.png)  
 Insert the updated name and click on the button _Save_  
 
 - **DELETE**: check the box on the left side of the class you wish to erase, and click on the blue button _Delete Selected Class_:  
 
 ![](20.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/20.png)

 ![](21.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/21.png)

 - **HOW TO USE CLASSES**: When you log in into your account, go to the Frontdesk tab: on the right hand side there will be a scroll down menu with the tag _View by Type_. Click on the scroll down menu and select _View by CLass_ in order to have your rooms grouped by classes:

##**Room Types**   

We have now come to the point of building your hotel's room types: as we understand it, a room 'type' is defined by the occupancy level, its position in the bulding and the type of amenities it offers. For example, common room types are 'King', 'Queen', 'Twin', and so on.  

 - Start by clicking on the link **Room Types** under section _Rooms_ in the Admin Settings:  
 
 ![](25.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/25.png)  
 
 - To create a new room type, click on the blue button _Add a Room Type_:  
 
 ![](24.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/24.png)  
 
 - Fill up the fields with the requested infromation: place the name of the room type in the field _Title_ and the accronym you want to use: the latter will show up before the actual room number for all those rooms listed under this type. Place a small description of your type, too:
 
 ![](26.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/26.png)  
 
 - Continue by filling in all information: from the _Room Alias_ drop down menu select whether the room type should be considered as different from a room: if you are a hostel, for example, you would probably choose 'bed' and if you are a campground, you will choose 'site':  

![](27.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/27.png)  

 - Choose whether your room is to be gender-based: choosing _yes_ will prompt the system to have you choose what gender you want to default the room to:  
 
 ![](28.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/28.png)  
 
 - Select the maximum and default occupancy, and select the amenities applicable to this type of room: you will see two small panels, one called _Available Amenities_ and another called _Selected Amenities_, with two arrows in the middle:  
 
 ![](29.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/29.png)
 
 Select the amenities you wish to apply to this room type by selecting them among the available ones and by using the arrows to move them from one panel to another: the one under panel _Selected Amenities_ will be the one showing up in the system:  
 
 ![](30.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/30.png)  
 
 - Finally, select whether this room type has to have an OBA and whether it should be restricted to only certain user levels. The OBA (**O**ver**b**ooking **A**llowance) will enable the room type to receive more bookings than the posted availability: you can decide how many overbookings you wish to allow by placing a numeric value in the box that appears when you check the box _OBA_:
