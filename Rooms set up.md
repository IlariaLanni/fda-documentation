#**Rooms Set Up**   

Setting up your rooms on your Frontdesk Anywhere is a good way to start building your account and make it look as familiar as your hotel. This operation involves not only creating rooms, but also building amentities, define the levels you wish to have rooms organize, load pictures and much more.   
In the sections below we will teach you the best ways to reproduce your hotel room structure in your account.

##**Amenities**

Let's start by creating the amenities that are available in your rooms. Make sure to create all of the amenities, independently of the type or room level in which they appear.   

  - In the Admin Settings, click on the link **Room Amenities**:

  - You will see a list of some defaulted amenities.

  - Before creating new ones, you can first edit those that you do not need, as this will make your account cleaner. For example, if you do not offer a laundry service in any of the rooms, but you offer a complimentary bathrobe, you will need to edit the laundry service and turn it into a bathrobe. To do this, click on the blue link _Edit_ on the corresponding row:

  - Edit the name in the _Amenity Title_ field, and click on the **Save** button when done.

  - To add a new amenity, click on the blue button **Add a New Amenity**: the procedure is the same as editing an amenity.
