#**General**  

The _General_ section of your Frontdesk Anywhere helps you personalize your account, set up hotel messages and configure automatic emails. You will also be able to decide which fields are to be mandatory in any reservation folio, and if necessary you will be given the option to create new ones.  


##**Languages**  

Frontdesk Anywhere comes with a few optional languages that you can set up as default for both your OBE and your PMS.

 - In the Admin Settings click on the link **Languages** under section _General_:  
 
![General_1.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/General_1.png)



 - You will see that English, Spanish and French are already loaded in the system: you can select which of these you want to have as default for your Online Booking Engine and for your system by checking the relevant boxes:  
 
![General_2.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/General_2.png)


 
 - You can also add different languages for some of the items in the system; to do this, click on the blue button _Add a Language_ and fill in all the fields with the appropriate translation:

 - When finished, click on the blue button _Save Language_ at the bottom of the page:  
 
 
![General_4.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/General_4.png)

 
 
 **NOTE** Making a certain language the default one does not mean that all users will have the same language upon log-in. Each user can choose a different language for the same account and they can set this up on the _Preferences_ area:  
 
![General_5.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/General_5.png)


 
 Setting up a default language only means that all _new_ users will see the system in that language upon their first log-in.   


##**Modes Of Arrival**  

Create your guest's modes of arrival to keep track of how they come to your property!  

 - In the Admin Settings, click on the link **Modes of Arrival** under section _General_:

![General_7.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/General_7.png)


 
 - If some of these arrival modes do not apply to your property, you can either deactivate them by un-checking the box under column _Status_:  
 
![General_8.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/General_8.png)


 
or you can erase them by selecting the check box on the left hand side of any Modes of Arrival, and by clicking on the blue button _Delete Selected Modes of Arrival_:

##**Guest Information and Reservation Information Custom Fields**  

Frontdesk Anywhere allows you to personalize the number and type of fields you want to have in your reservation folios. Before starting, let us look at a reservation folio:  

![80r.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/80r.png)


You will notice that the folio is made out of three columns: the first one contains general information about the reservation, the middle one has fields regarding information about profiles. A profile can be a Guest, a Travel Agent or a Company.

The links _Reservation Information: Custom Fields_ and _Guest Information: Custom Fields_ in the Admin Settings are the links via which you can configure what appears in those folio sections: 

 - In the Admin Settings, click on the link _Guest Information: Custom Fields_:  
 
![81r.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/81r.png)
 
 
 - You will see a list of all the current active fields in your folios:  
 
![83r.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/83r.png)

 
 - For each field, select whether you want it active or not by checking/unchecking the box under column _Status_:  
 
![84r.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/84r.png)

 
 **Note**: it is currently impossible to erase a field. If you do not wish to have a field showing in your folios, you will simply need to make it **Inactive**.  
 
 - For any field, select whether the field is required by checking/unchecking the box under column _Required_:  

![85r.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/85r.png)


When you mark a field as **Required**, the system will force agents to insert the information into that field before they are able to create/operate on a folio.  

 - To add a Custom Field, click on the blue button _Add Custom Field_ at the bottom of the page:  
 
![86r.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/86r.png)
 
 
 - Insert the name in the first box and choose what _type_ of field you want to create by picking the irght choice form the scrll down menu:  
 
![89r.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/89r.png)

 
 A **TEXT** option will create an editable field like the following: 
 
![91r.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/91r.png)


 A **SELECT** option will create a scroll down menu with different options for the agent to select, like this one:  
 
![92r.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/92r.png)

 
 If you choose to create one, save it and then add those options by clicking on the blue link _Add Option_:  
 
![90r.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/90r.png)

 
 Insert your options and click on the button _Save_.
 
 A **MULTISELECT** option will create a scroll down menu where multiple options can be chosen, like the following one:  
 
![95r.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/95r.png)

 
 If you want to create one, save it and then add the options by clicking on the blue link _Add Option_:  
 
![94r.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/94r.png)

 
 A **TEXT AREA** will create a comment box in the folio guest profile:  
 
![96r.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/96r.png)

 
  - As mentioned above, you can create information for Guests, but also for Travel Agents and Company profiles. To create fields for the latter, select your option form the scroll down menu that appears on top of the _Guest Profile Custom Fields_ list:  
  
![97r.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/97r.png)

  
  - The _Reservation Information: Custom Fields_ link works the same as the _Guest Information: Custom Fields_ one.  


##**Display Colors**
  
  Your account comes with a set of colors that you can easily personalize. Colors are used to define the status of a reservation and of rooms, they are employed to give you a good first-glance understanding of what is happening at your property at any time by just looking at your Tape Chart.  

 - In the Admin Settings, click on the blue link **Display Colors** under section _General_: 
 
![98r.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/98r.png)

 
 - You will have a list of all the reservation and room status with the respective default colors:  
 
![99r.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/99r.png)
 
 
 - To change the color for any of these statuses, click on the colored field with the color code:  
 
![100r.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/100r.png)

 
 - Choose the colo you want by moving the arrows up or down on the color scale:  
 
![101r.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/101r.png)

 
 - Select your choice by clicking on the colored disc on the bottom right side of the small color panel:  
 
![102r.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/102r.png)

 
 - You can add more colors by clicking on the blue button **Add** next to the tag _Front Desk User Defined Colors_:  
 
![103r.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/103r.png)

 
 - To remove one color, just click on the blue button _Remove_ on the right hand side of any custom status:  

![104r.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/104r.png)


##**Alerts**

Frontdesk Anywhere can help you reducing the margin of human error that is involved in the daily management of your hotel. You can set up the system to warn users when a possible damaging action is about to be taken: for example, if a guest is about to be checked-in into a dirty room, or if a guest is about to be checked-out with an outstanding balance, security deposit.

- In the Admin Settings, click on the link **Alerts** under section _General_:  

![106r.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/106r.png)


- You will see a list of possible warnings that can be enabled in the system:  

![107r.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/107r.png)


- For any action, you have two options: if you want to have the system only trigger a message alert, then check the box under the column _Status_; if you want to have the system prevent the agent from pursuing the correspondent action, check the box under column _Force Correction of Alerts_:  

![108r.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/108r.png)
 

##**Tape Chart**  

From time to time it might happen that you will need to update your Tape Chart: for example, if you are undergoing some display issue where a reservation does not have an updated status, running the Tape Chart will automatically refresh all of your bookings.

 - In the Admin Settings, click on the link **Tape Chart**, under section _General_:  
 
![109r.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/109r.png)
 
 
 - The screen will show you when the Tape Chart was run last:  
 
![110r.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/110r.png)

 
 - To run the Tape Chart, click on the blue button _Run Tape Chart_:  
 
![111r.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/111r.png)
