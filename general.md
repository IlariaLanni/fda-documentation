#**General**  

The _General_ section of your Frontdesk Anywhere helps you personalize your account, set up hotel messages and configure automatic emails. You will also be able to decide which fields are to be mandatory in any reservation folio, and if necessary you will be given the option to create new ones.  


##**Languages**  

Frontdesk Anywhere comes with a few optional languages that you can set up as default for both your OBE and your PMS.

 - In the Admin Settings click on the link **Languages** under section _General_:

 ![](43.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/43.png)  
 
 **NOTE** Making a certain language the default one does not mean that all users will have the same language upon log-in. Each user can choose a different language for the same account and they can set this up on the _Preferences_ area:  
 
 ![](45.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/45.png)
 
 Setting up a default language only means that all _new_ users will see the system in that language upon their first log-in.

##**Guest Information and Reservation Information Custom Fields**  

Frontdesk Anywhere allows you to personalize the number and type of fields you want to have in your reservation folios. Before starting, let us look at a reservation folio:  

![](![80.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/80.png)  

You will notice that the folio is made out of three columns: the first one contains general information about the reservation, the middle one has fields regarding guest information. The links _Reservation Information: Custom Fields_ and _Guest Information: Custom Fields_ in the Admin Settings are the links via which you can configure what appears in those folio sections: 

 - In the Admin Settings, click on the link _Guest Information: Custom Fields_:  
 
 ![](81.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/81.png)  
 
 - You will see a list of all the current active fields in your folios:  
 
 ![](83.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/83.png)  
 
 - For each field, select whether you want it active or not by checking/unchecking the box under column _Status_:  
 
 ![](84.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/84.png)  
 
 **Note**: it is currently impossible to erase a field. If you do not wish to have a field showing in your folios, you will simply need to make it inactive.  
 
 - For any field, select whether the field is required by checking/unchecking the box under column _Required_:  

![](85.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/85.png)  

When you mark a field as **Required**, the system will force agents to insert the information into that field before they are able to create/operate on a folio.  

 - To add a Custom Field, click on the blue button _Add Custom Field_ at the bottom of the page:  
 
 ![](86.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/86.png)

 A **SELECT** option will create a scroll down menu with different options for the agent to select.  If you choose to create one, save it anfd then add those options by clicking on the blue link _Add Option_:
