#**General**  

The _General_ section of your Frontdesk Anywhere helps you personalize your account, set up hotel messages and configure automatic emails. You will also be able to decide which fields are to be mandatory in any reservation folio, and if necessary you will be given the option to create new ones.  

##**Guest Messages**  

The Guest Messages are messages that will appear in some areas of your Frontdesk Anywhere Online Booking Engine (for example Terms and Conditons) and on your Email Templates. You can think of them as _snippet_ messages that will then be applied to all communications you will set up to have with your guests.  

 - In the Admin Settings, click on the link **Guest Messages** under section _General_:
