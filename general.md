#**General**  

The _General_ section of your Frontdesk Anywhere helps you personalize your account, set up hotel messages and configure automatic emails. You will also be able to decide which fields are to be mandatory in any reservation folio, and if necessary you will be given the option to create new ones.  

##**Guest Messages**  

The Guest Messages are messages that will appear in some areas of your Frontdesk Anywhere Online Booking Engine (for example Terms and Conditons) and on your Email Templates. You can think of them as _snippet_ messages that will then be applied to all communications you will set up to have with your guests.  

 - In the Admin Settings, click on the link **Guest Messages** under section _General_:

 - You will see different panels, each one editable and with a title on the top that should give you some guidance on what sort of information you should type in the editable box:

 - The first one is the _Invoice Message_: this is a message that will appear in each of your property invoices:

 - Proceed to edit the _Terms and Conditons_ message: the latter will show up on your Online Booking Engine, and your confirmation email:  
 
 ![](4.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/4.png)  
 
 - The third message will be the _Room Cancellation_ message: as the text in the box says, this will appear both on your Booking Engine and in your cancellation email:

 - Finally, edit your _Guest Receipt_ and your _Registration Card_ messages:

 - When finished, scroll at the bottom of the page and click on the blue button _Save_:

 ##**Email Templates**  

Frontdesk Anywhere allows you to customize all communications with your guests: all templates are in a html format, and they can be easily editable; however, your account already comes with some defaults templates that you can enable and start using.  

 - In the Admin Settings, click on the blue link **Email Templates** under section _General_:  
 
 ![](9.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/9.png)  
 
 - You will see a list of all the types of templates that the system offers: the name of each template appears on the top left hand side of each message panel.
 
 ![](11.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/11.png)  
 
 - Under each section you will see one disabled template already listed: these templates are only used as a guidance, and they are non-editable:

 - To create a new template, click on the button _New template_ on the top left hand side of the screen:  
 
 ![](13.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/13.png)  
 
 - Select the template you want to create by clicking on the right option in the scroll down menu:  
 
 ![](14.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/14.png)  
 
 - Give a name to the template:
