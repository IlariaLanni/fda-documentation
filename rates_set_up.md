#**Rates** 

This section covers everything you need to know about rates set-up, taxes, fees and add-ons. We will start with tax and fee creation before going into the different ways you can reproduce your rate structure into Frontdesk Anywhere.  

##**Taxes and Fees**

 - In the Admin Settings, click on the link **Taxes** under section _Rates_:  

![](1.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/1.png)  

You will see a list of the existing taxes in the system: your Frontdesk Anywhere comes with three default taxes. At the moment although it is possible to deactivate a tax, it is not possible to erase it: hence, we advise to edit the existing ones, before creating new ones, as this will help keep your account cleaner.

 - To edit a tax, click on the blue link _Edit_ on the right hand side of the tax you want to amend:  
 
 ![](2.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/2.png)  
 
 - Insert all information requested: the _Tax Title_ will appear in each reservation where the tax is applied, so we advise it to keep the name simple.   
You will need to choose whether to make the tax a fixed amount or a percentage by clicking on the right circle box. If you choose to make the tax a flat fee to be added, specify whether the amount has to be added on a per reservation or per night basis:

 If you are creating an inclusive tax, tick the box with the tag _Inclusive Tax_: if this box is checked, the tax will only appear when reporting, and it won't show anywhere in reservations. 

 - Once you have done, click on the _Save_ button: if you need to create a new tax, click on the blue button _Add a Tax_; the process is the same as editing one:

###**TAX OPERATIONS**  

 - **Deactivate**: to make a tax inactive, simply uncheck the box under column _Status_, on the right hand side of the relevant tax:  

![](![7.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/7.png)

As mentioned before, it is not possible to erase a tax: however, making a tax inactive will ensure that the tax won't show up anywhere in the system. 


##**Rates Set-Up**  

There are different ways you can create and operate on a rate. Although the system comes with a couple of rates already built-in, it will be good to start by creating a brand new rate.  

 - In the Admin Settings, click on the blue link **Rate Classes** under section _Rates_ and click on the blue button _NEW_ at the bottom of the page:  
 
 ![](8.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/8.png)  
 
 - You are now in the heart of a rate configuration, and you will see different information to fill in. Let's start by placing a name for your new rate, next to the tag _Rate Code_, and a brief description of the rate:  
 
 ![](9.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/9.png)  
 
 If you are using the Frontdesk Anywhere booking engine, you will see the description show up underneath the name of the rate, when a guest is trying to make reservation online: for this reason, we advise to keep the description simple.
 
 - Check the box _Active_ if you want the rate to be enabled upon creation, and check the box _Allow Override_ if you want to enable the possibility to edit the rate on a reservation basis. Also, check the boxes for all the rate's applicable taxes:  
 
 ![](10.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/10.png)  
 
If you choose to check the _Allow Override_ box, the rate will become editable on the reservation folio. This means that the _Edit Rate_ link will become clickable.

- Specify the type of rate you are creating by selecting the right option in the scroll down menu, next to the tag _Rate Type_:  

![](12.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/12.png)  

If you choose the option _Nightly_ rate, the value you will insert will be considered as the nightly price.  
If you choose the option _Multiple Nights_, you will need to specify how many nights the rate is valid for. You can place a numeric value in the box _Rate Is Valid For_. The value you insert will be considered as the total price for the number of nights you define in that box. In the example below I am creating a weekly rate: 

![](![13.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/13.png)  

Keep in mind that if you create a multiple nights rate, the latter will not show up anywhere unless the minimum number of nights are selected.
