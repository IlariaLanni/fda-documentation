#** MULTIPLE ROOMS RESERVATION ** 
Creating a multiple rooms reservation for small or large groups is easy in Frontdesk Anywhere: from only one panel you are able to streamline the reservation process, manage booking status, set up payment rules and print/send group messages.       
##**Step 1.** New Group      
  - Begin by clicking on the blue button _NEW GROUP_ on top of your Tape Chart:

  - A new window will pop up: insert the Group Name in the first field, and select the Source and Market from the available options in the second and last field. Once done, click on the blue button _NEXT_:

##**Step 2.** Choose the group’s stay date and the room information     
   - Using the two scroll down calendars, select the check-in and check-out dates of the group. If you need shoulder dates, or if part of the group is staying longer/shorter, you will be able to adjust details in the next step.

   - Choose the room type of your choice by selecting the right option from the respective scroll down menu: if the group has booked more than one room type, you will be given the option to add more rooms once _**Step 2**_ is completed:

When you choose a room type, the scroll down menus with the tags _Rates_ and _No. Rooms_ will automatically update to give you the number of available rooms and rates for the dates of your choice.   
- If you wish to customize the rate for the group, you can  do this by clicking on the blue link **Edit Rate**, next to the _Rate_ scroll down menu.
You will have two options: you can either edit the daily rate by clicking on the circle box _Daily Price Edit_:

or you can click on the circle box _Fixed Price Edit_ to change the total rate for each room:

Click on the yellow button **Update** to save your changes.   
 
   - Choose how you want to assign rooms for this group.   
   You will have three options:    
![](7.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/7.png)   

**Auto Assign** will have the system automatically assign the rooms among the ones available.   
**Unassign** will create the group without any room assignment.   
**Manual Assign** will enable you to choose the rooms among the ones available.   

Select your option and click on the blue button **Add Rooms**.   

##**Step 3.** Manual Assignment (skip to Step 4 if not applicable)   
- If you chose the Manual Assignment option, the following panel will pop-up:

Click on the blue button **Add Rooms*.   

##**Step 4.** Select Group Reservation Status   

- Once the rooms are added, there will appear a brief summary of the group details: you will now need to choose the group reservation status.   

![](10.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/10.png)   

Choose:   

**Reserve** if you want to finalize the reservation as reserved   
**Hold** if you want to hold rooms for the group without fully reserving them      
**Block / DNR** if you want to take the rooms out of your current inventory   

- If you choose to hold rooms, you will be given two options:   
![](![11.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/11.png)   

If you select a _Manual Release_ for the rooms, the rooms will stay in a Hold status until you manually change the status within the Group Folio.   

If you select _Automatic Release_ you will need to choose a certain date from the scroll down calendar: the system will automatically release the rooms on that date, if the latter have not been reserved up to then.   

##**Step 5.**  Removing a room from the Room Queue   
- If you made a mistake and reserved too many rooms, you can remove the extra ones by clicking on the button _Remove_:‘Remove’:   
![](12.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/12.png)   

- Select the number of rooms you wish to remove and click on the blue button **Save**.   

When ready, you can click on the button **Next** to go to the next step.   

**NOTE**: If you wish to add more room types to the reservation, you will need to repeat **Step 2**.   

##**Step 6.** Group Rules   

Group Rules are used to set up group payments: from this panel you can decide to transfer charges to an onsite or offsite payer, split the payment among the reservations that are part of the group, group together charges, and so on. When a group is created, all charges are, by default, transferred to one reservation folio, which represents the group's leader. If you want to changemkiy
