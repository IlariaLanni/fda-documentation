summary: "The Profile Tab contains information about your guests, travel agents, companies, and any business source your hotels uses or has a partnership with. You can think of profiles as sort of special containers that gather a wide range of information, from demosgraphics to payment history. Profiles are also very useful when creating new reservations, as information is stored and prompted as suggestions in the folios."   




##**Single Profile**  


A Single Profile is the most common type of profile, as it collects all guest information. Single profiles are created any time a new reservation is created, regardless of the channel via which it interfaces with your PMS. For returning guests all information can easily get pulled down into the reservation folio, thus helping avoid human errors and making the reservation process much more rapid!



###**Creating a Single Profile from a Folio**  


Every reservation folio is tied to a Profile ID, which you can look up in the Profile tab. When a reservation is made, the system will automatically generate a new profile: 

- The central column of a folio is dedicated to the Guest Information: information entered in this column will be the one stored in the Profile.

- Fill in all reservation information, and click on the blue button _Reserve_:  

![profiles_2.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profiles_2.png)  

- When the folio acquires a status (Hold, Reserved, etc), it will be linked to a Profile ID:  

![profiles_3.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profiles_3.png)  


- If you add additional guests in the folio, the system will also generate new Profile IDs for them. Click on the button _Additional Guests_ on the top of the panel:  


![profiles_4.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profiles_4.png)


- A new panel will pop up: click on the blue button _Add Guest_:  

![profiles_5.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profiles_5.png)  


- Fill in all information, and when ready click on the button _Save_ at the bottom. Once done, you will see the additional guest Profile ID on the left hand side of the guest's name:

**Important!**: if you wish to make amendments to the information of the guest in the folio, make sure to click on the link _EDIT_:  


![profiles_7.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profiles_7.png)  



If you click on the button _CHANGE_, the system will replace the existing guest, and hence the existing Profile ID linked to them, with a new one!    



- You can look up guests by Profile IDs in a simple way: click on the tab _Profiles_ on the top of your Tape Chart:  


![profiles_8.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profiles_8.png)  


- Insert the Profile ID number in the text box: the right profile will automatically be pulled up:  


![profiles_9.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profiles_9.png)  


- Clicking on the Profile will enable you to have access to all information tied to the profile:

###**Pulling Down Returning Guests Information from Folio**  


When making a reservation on your Tape Chart, if the information you are entering matches any existent Profile ID then a suggestion will be prompted to you:  

- Click on any available room on your Tape Chart, to make a new reservation:  

![profiles_11.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profiles_11.png)  

- Start by filling in the Guest Information: if what you are typing matches existent guest information stored in your account, then a suggestion will be prompted to you:  

![profiles_12.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profiles_12.png)  


- The profile ID will appear on the left hand side of any prompted suggestion:  

![profiles_13.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profiles_13.png)  


- If the suggestion is chosen, all information tied to the Profile ID will automatically populate in the folio:  


![profiles_14.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profiles_14.png)  


**Note**: it is important to make sure to choose the right profile, if you dealing with a returning guest. At the moment it is **not** possible to merge profiles, so in order to avoid having multiple profiles belonging to same guest, you should be careful to choose the right prompted suggestion. The option to merge profiles will be available in the near future!
