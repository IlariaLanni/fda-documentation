summary: "The Profile Tab contains information about your guests, travel agents, companies, and any business source your hotels uses or has a partnership with. You can think of profiles as sort of special containers that gather a wide range of information, from demographics to payment history to guest preferences. Profiles are also very useful when creating new reservations, as information is stored and prompted as suggestions in the folios."   



##**Getting Set Up/Profile Templates**
  
  
Before you learn how to create and use the different profiles available for your account, it is important to have all templates set-up for this section. This is important to have everything ready, before you actually start using any of the profiles!  

- To add the Templates and Messages you need, follow the instructions on section [Templates](http://docs.frontdeskanywhere.net.s3-website-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/build/messages_and_emails.html#templates) in this manual.  


{{site.data.alerts.important}}Remember to choose the option _Profiles_ when you enable the template: {{site.data.alerts.end}}

##**Single Profile**  


A Single Profile is the most common type of profile, as it collects all guest information. Single profiles are created any time a new reservation is created, regardless of the channel via which it interfaces with your PMS. For returning guests all information can easily get pulled down into the reservation folio, thus helping avoid human errors and making the reservation process much more rapid!



###**Creating a Single Profile from a Folio**  


Every reservation folio is tied to a Profile ID, which you can look up in the Profile tab. When a reservation is made, the system will automatically generate a new profile: 

- The central column of a folio is dedicated to the Guest Information: information entered in this column will be the one stored in the Profile.  

![profiles_1.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profiles_1.png)  


- Fill in all reservation information, and click on the blue button _Reserve_:  

![profiles_2.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profiles_2.png)  

- When the folio acquires a status (Hold, Reserved, etc), it will be linked to a Profile ID:  

![profiles_3.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profiles_3.png)  


- If you add additional guests in the folio, the system will also generate new Profile IDs for them. Click on the button _Additional Guests_ on the top of the panel:  


![profiles_4.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profiles_4.png)


- A new panel will pop up: click on the blue button _Add Guest_:  

![profiles_5.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profiles_5.png)  


- Fill in all information, and when ready click on the button _Save_ at the bottom. Once done, you will see the additional guest Profile ID on the left hand side of the guest's name:  

![profiles_6.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profiles_6.png)  


**Important!**: if you wish to make amendments to the information of the guest in the folio, make sure to click on the link _EDIT_:  


![profiles_7.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profiles_7.png)  



If you click on the button _Change_, the system will replace the existing guest, and hence the existing Profile ID linked to them, with a new one!    



- You can look up guests by Profile IDs in a simple way: click on the tab _Profiles_ on the top of your Tape Chart:  


![profiles_8.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profiles_8.png)  


- Insert the Profile ID number in the text box: the right profile will automatically be pulled up:  


![profiles_9.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profiles_9.png)  


- Clicking on the Profile will enable you to have access to all information tied to the profile:  


![profiles_10.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profiles_10.png)



###**Pulling Down Returning Guests Information from Folio**  


When making a reservation on your Tape Chart, if the information you are entering matches any existent Profile ID then a suggestion will be prompted to you:  

- Click on any available room on your Tape Chart, to make a new reservation:  

![profiles_11.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profiles_11.png)  

- Start by filling in the Guest Information: if what you are typing matches existent guest information stored in your account, then a suggestion will be prompted to you:  

![profiles_12.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profiles_12.png)  


- The profile ID will appear on the left hand side of any prompted suggestion:  

![profiles_13.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profiles_13.png)  


- If the suggestion is chosen, all information tied to the Profile ID will automatically populate in the folio:  


![profiles_14.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profiles_14.png)  


**Note**: it is important to make sure to choose the right profile, if you dealing with a returning guest. At the moment it is **not** possible to merge profiles, so in order to avoid having multiple profiles belonging to same guest, you should be careful to choose the right prompted suggestion. The option to merge profiles will be available in the near future!

**Important**: if you create a Profile directly from the folio, credit card information is not going to be pulled down next time you make a reservation for the guest. If you want to save credit card information for a Profile so that anytime you pull down information in a folio the credit card number also appear, you will need to save that information directly in the Profile tab.  


###**Creating a Single Profile from the Profile Tab** 

If you need to load guest information that is not in the system, you can create profiles directly in the _Profile_ tab.  

- The _Profile_ tab is accessible form the top of your Tape Chart:  


![profiles_15.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profiles_15.png)  


- Click on the _Profile_ tab:  

![profiles_16.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profiles_16.png)  

The tab is divided into three parts: the left column enables you to create and search profiles. The _Look Up_ function is a short route to look up folios associated with the right profile, if needed.  

The central part will give you a list of the most recent created Profiles, and a field where to look up Profile IDs.   

The right hand side contains details information about the Profiles.  


- To create a new Single Profile, click on the link _Create Profile_, on the left hand side of the screen:  

![profiles_18.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profiles_18.png)  

- Insert all guest information: the fields are not different from the ones appearing in the folios: as we are creating a Single Profile, choose the option **Guest** from the _Profile Type_ drop down menu:   

![profiles_19.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profiles_19.png)  


- Proceed to fill in all Guest Details and when done, click on the button _Save_ at the bottom of the page:  

![profiles_20.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profiles_20.png)  
 
 
- Click on the link _Profiles_, on the top left hand side of the panel:  


![profiles_21.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profiles_21.png)   


- The profile you have just created will appear in the list at the center of the page. Click on the profile to load information for that Profile:  


![profiles_22.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profiles_22.png)  


- To add Credit Card Informaton to the Profile, click on the tab _Credit Card_:  


![profiles_23.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profiles_23.png)  


- Click on the icon with the three horizontal lines and choose to _Add Card_:  


![profiles_24.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profiles_24.png)  


- Fill in all information and click on the green button _Save_:  


![profiles_25.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profiles_25.png)  


The credit card information will appear in the folio whenever you pull down the guest profile.  



##**Creating a Travel Agent or Company Profile**  


A **Company Profile** contains information about companies with which the hotel has special partnerships with: you will be able to transfer guest charges directly to the profile, create separate invoices, and keep track of payments.   


A **Travel Agent** profile is useful to track charges to apply to the Travel Agents or calculate commissions.


Although they serve different purposes, creation and usage of both profiles is the same, so the information below can be used interchangeably.  



###**Adding Customizable Fields for Travel Agent/Company Profiles**  


As a first thing, you will need to add all those fields you want to be applicable and required for Travel Agents and Companies: differently from a Guest Profile, 
fields for Company/Travel Agent profiles may be drastically different from one hotel to another: for this reason there are no fields loaded in the system, and you will have to create them all.  

Check out section [Guest Custom Fields](http://docs.frontdeskanywhere.net.s3-website-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/build/general.html#guest-information-and-reservation-information-custom-fields) for instructions on how to create custom fields.  

{{site.data.alerts.note}} Remember to select the right option from the custom fields page when creating fields for Companies or Travel Agents: {{site.data.alerts.end}}

![profiles_34.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profiles_34.png)  




##**Transferring Folio Charges to Profiles**  

Transferring charges from individual or group folios to a Profile enables you to keep track of credits/debts of each hotel partner associated with the Profile. This operation is a two-step process.


###**Step 1 - Create an Invoice for the Profile**  

Before starting with our transfer, we need to make sure there is a place where we can transfer charges _to_: for this reason, we will need to create an Invoice directly in the Profile tab, corresponsing to the relative Profile!  

- Click on the Profile tab on top of your Tape Chart:  

![profiles_42.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profiles_42.png)  

- Look up your Profile and click on the _Transactions_ tab on the left hand side of the screen:  

![profiles_43.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profiles_43.png)


- Click on the button _Create Invoice_:  


![profiles_44.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profiles_44.png)  


- A new drop down menu with the tag _New Invoice_ will appear below the Create Invoice button:  


![profiles_45.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profiles_45.png)  


- Click on the written _New Invoice_, and the field will become editable: place the name you want to give the Invoice and **click ENTER on your keyboard** to save your changes:  


![profiles_46.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profiles_46.png)

  
- Make sure you note down the Profile Number associated with the newly created invoice:  


![profiles_47.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profiles_47.png)  


###**Step 2 - Transferring Charges to The Profile Invoice**    


Now that you have your Invoice created for the right Profile, you can proceed to transfer charges from the folio/s.  

- Open the folio you want to transfer charges from:  


![profiles_48.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profiles_48.png)  


- Click on the blue link _Payments_ to access the payment panel:  


![profiles_49.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profiles_49.png)  


- Click on the _Uninvoiced Transactions_ drop down menu to visualize all charges that have not yet been invoiced and that you can transfer to the Profile:  


![profiles_50.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profiles_50.png)  


- Select the charges you wish to transfer by clicking on the check-boxes on the left hand side of each charge type:  


![profiles_51.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profiles_51.png)  


- Click on the button _Transfer Charges_ on the top left hand side of the screen: you will see a small editable box with the written _Profile Search_. 


![profiles_52.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profiles_52.png)  


- In the _Profile Search_ box place the number of the profile you want to transfer charges to: a suggestion will be prompted to you.

![profiles_53.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profiles_53.png)  


- Click on the prompted suggestion and all created invoices for that Profile will appear as clickable options. In the example below, our Profile has only one Invoice created, called _Wedding Party_:  

![profiles_54.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profiles_54.png)  

- When charges are transferred, you won't be able to see them in the _Uninvoiced Transaction List_ anymore, and they will be taken off the overrall balance of the folio. A new drop down menu will appear, called _Trasferred Transactions_ and it will bear information on all transferred charges:  


![profiles_55.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profiles_55.png)




{{site.data.alerts.important}} Clicking on the Invoice will have the system automatically transfer the charges. Although charges are easily reversable, take extra care to select the right Invoice! {{site.data.alerts.end}}
  
  
  
- The charges that have been transferred to the Profile will now appear in the selected invoice, in the Profile Tab:  
  


![profiles_56.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profiles_56.png)



###**Reversing Transfers From a Profile Invoice to a Folio**  

If you made a mistake when transferring charges to the profile, you may reverse transfers easily, directly from the folio.  


- Click on the folio where transfers have been sent from:  


![profiles_57.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profiles_57.png)  


- Click on the blue link _Payments_ and access the payment panel:  

![profiles_58.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profiles_58.png)  


- You will see a drop down menu with the written _Transferred Transactions_: if you click on it, you will see a list of all those transactios that have been transferred to the Profile Invoice:
