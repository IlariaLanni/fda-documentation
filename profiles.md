summary: "The Profile Tab contains information about your guests, travel agents, companies, and any business source your hotels uses or has a partnership with. You can think of profiles as sort of special containers that gather a wide range of information, from demosgraphics to payment history. Profiles are also very useful when creating new reservations, as information is stored and prompted as suggestions in the folios."
