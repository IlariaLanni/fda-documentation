summary: "The Profile Tab contains information about your guests, travel agents, companies, and any business source your hotels uses or has a partnership with. You can think of profiles as sort of special containers that gather a wide range of information, from demosgraphics to payment history. Profiles are also very useful when creating new reservations, as information is stored and prompted as suggestions in the folios."   




##**Single Profile**  


A Single Profile is the most common type of profile, as it collects all guest information. Single profiles are created any time a new reservation is created, regardless of the channel via which it interfaces with your PMS. For returning guests all information can easily get pulled down into the reservation folio, thus helping avoid human errors and making the reservation process much more rapid!



###**Creating a Profile from a Folio**  


Every reservation folio is tied to a Profile ID, which you can look up in the Profile tab. When a reservation is made, the system will automatically generate a new profile: 

- The central column of a folio is dedicated to the Guest Information: information entered in this column will be the one stored in the Profile.

- Fill in all reservation information, and click on the blue button _Reserve_:

- When the folio acquires a status (Hold, Reserved, etc), it will be linked to a Profile ID:
