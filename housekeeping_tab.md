##Housekeeping Tab Organization and Set-up 

The Housekeeping Tab is located just on top of your Tape Chart. Depending on the kind of  access level, and personal preferences, some users might directly log in into the Housekeeping tab without having to click, in order to access it.  

Click on the tab _Housekeeping_ on the top of the screen:  

![Housekeeping_tab_1.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Housekeeping_tab_1.png)


You will see a panel with different filters. Here is how the screen is organized.  


###Top Filters 


- There are two different types of filters. The top ones need to be used to visualize or order the housekeeping list.  

The first filter, called _Housekeeping Status_ is multi-option filter, and you will need to use it to define what housekeeping statuses you wish to display:  


![Housekeeping_tab_2.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Housekeeping_tab_2.png)    


- The middle filter, _Housekeeper_ is used to filter room by housekeepers and see what the workload is assigned to a certain employee. Upon first use, the list will be empty. This is because you will need to first **add housekeepers**. To do this, click on the link _Employee List_ on the left hand side of the panel:

- Another panel will pop up: fill in the details you deem important, and when finished click on the button _Save_ at the bottom of the page:  

![Housekeeping_tab_5.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Housekeeping_tab_5.png)


- To add more employees, click on the green button _Add an Employee_:  


![Housekeeping_tab_6.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Housekeeping_tab_6.png)  


- To delete an employee, select the latter by checking the box on the left hand side of user name and click on the red button _Delete Selected Employees_:  


![Housekeeping_tab_7.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Housekeeping_tab_7.png)  


- You will now be able to see the list of employees you have created. You might need to refresh the page before seeing changes being effective!

- FInally, the top left filter with the tag _Housekeeping View_ gives you different options on how to display the daily housekeeping workload:  

![Housekeeping_tab_9.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Housekeeping_tab_9.png)  



###Assign Filters  

The second row of filters are used to assign workload, change housekeeping status and assign priority.  

- The first filter, called _Assign Housekeeping Status_ displays all housekeeping statuses:  

![Housekeeping_tab_10.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Housekeeping_tab_10.png)  


- The middle filter, tagged _Assign Housekeeper_ will be used to asign workload to any housekeeper configured. Note that there is always an _Unassigned_ option, which can be used to assign rooms that do not need employees work:  

![Housekeeping_tab_11.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Housekeeping_tab_11.png)


- The last filter, marked with the tag _Assign Housekeeping ROom Priority_ can be used to prioritize workload:

##Visualize the Daily Workload 

- Start by choosing your preferred view by using the _Housekeeping View_ filter. In the exmaple below I am using the _View by Floor_ to display all of my hotel's daily housekeeping workload organized by floors:  


![Housekeeping_tab_13.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Housekeeping_tab_13.png)  


- Notice that the system will always keep a count of the items displayed: the count of rooms is dynamic, meaning that if I choose to display only the Dirty Rooms, the number will remind only to how many Dirty room there are:  


![Housekeeping_tab_14.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Housekeeping_tab_14.png)  


- For any view you choose, the information will be grouped under pre-defined columns. The column _Room_ refers to the room number and room type in question. The column _Housekeeping Status_ displays the the current Housekeeping status:  


![Housekeeping_tab_15.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Housekeeping_tab_15.png)  


- The _Expected Status_ column is used to identify the expected status of the room after the hotel's check-out time:  


![Housekeeping_tab_16.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Housekeeping_tab_16.png)  


- The _Rooms Status - Tonight_  column will give information of the expected status of the room at the end of the day. This column will be useful to prioritize workload: housekeepers will have information about whether a room will be checking-in or whether it is going to be available, thus enabling them to organize their work more efficiently:  


![Housekeeping_tab_17.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Housekeeping_tab_17.png)  


- The _Housekeeper_ column displays the name of the employees to whom the room has been assigned: note that it displays _Unassigned_ until you are going to assign the workload to a certain employee:  


![Housekeeping_tab_18.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Housekeeping_tab_18.png)  


- The column _Housekeeping Priority_ will show the relevant priority assigned to the rooms:  


![Housekeeping_tab_19.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Housekeeping_tab_19.png)



##How To Read The Tab 

- Let us look at the following example:  


![Housekeeping_tab_20.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Housekeeping_tab_20.png)  


**Room K-06**: The current Housekeeping Status is _Clean_, and it is currently _Available_, however we know that tonight a guest is expected to check-in.  
**Room K-05**: The current Status has been marked as _Insepct_, and it is currently _Available_ and due to have someone checking-in.  
**Room K-04**: The current Status is _Dirty Departing_, hence the guest currently in-house is _Expected_ to check-out. We also know that tonight the room will be vacant.  
**Room QQ-03**:  The current Status is _Dirty Vacant_, meaning that the guest has already checked-out: indeed, the expected status is _Checking-Out_, and we know that a guest will be checking-in the room tonight.  
**Room QQ-01**: The current Status is _Dirty_, as the guest is not due to check-out today. Indeed, both expected status at check-out time and the status tonight is _Stay Over_.
 
 

##How to Assign Workload 

- In order to assign rooms to the employees, you will simply need to selected the rooms by checking the check-box on the left hand side and use the _Assign Housekeeper_ filter to complete the action:  


![Housekeeping_tab_21.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Housekeeping_tab_21.png)  


- If you want to assign rooms on the basis of the current _Housekeeping Status_, you can first filter by status, and then proceed to assign it. In the example below I am displaying all _Dirty Departing_ and _Dirty Vacant_ rooms:  



![Housekeeping_tab_22.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Housekeeping_tab_22.png)  



- You will now be able to change the Housekeeping View to _View by Housekeeper_, in order to get information on all assigned workload:  


![Housekeeping_tab_23.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Housekeeping_tab_23.png)  


- You will also have the chance to print all the workload by clicking on the button _Print_; you can do this for any view you choose:  


![Housekeeping_tab_24.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Housekeeping_tab_24.png)  


##How to Change the Housekeeping Status

As the day goes by and work gets done by your employees, your Housekeepers will need to change the Housekeeping Status, ideally to status _Clean_.

- Select the rooms for which you wish to change the status by selecting the check-boxes on the left side. Use the _Assign Housekeeping Status_ to choose the right status:  


![Housekeeping_tab_25.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Housekeeping_tab_25.png)


The updated status will appear in real-time to the Frontdesk users on the left hand side of any room. The statuses are color coded, and the Frontdesk users will need to refresh the page to get the most updated information:
