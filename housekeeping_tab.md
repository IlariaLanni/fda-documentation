##**Housekeeping Tab**  

The Housekeeping Tab is located just on top of your Tape Chart. Depending on the kind of  access level, and personal preferences, some users might directly log in into the Housekeeping tab without having to click, in order to access it.  

Click on the tab _Housekeeping_ on the top of the screen:

You will see a panel with different filters. Here is how the screen is organized.  

- There are two different types of filters. The top ones need to be used to visualize or order the housekeeping list.  

The first filter, called _Housekeeping Status_ is multi-option filter, and you will need to use it to define what housekeeping statuses you wish to display:

- The middle filter, _Housekeeper_ is used to filter room by housekeepers and see what the workload is assigned to a certain employee. Upon first use, the list will be empty. This is because you will need to first **add housekeepers**. To do this, click on the link _Employee List_ on the left hand side of the panel:
