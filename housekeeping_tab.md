##**Housekeeping Tab Organization and Set-up**  

The Housekeeping Tab is located just on top of your Tape Chart. Depending on the kind of  access level, and personal preferences, some users might directly log in into the Housekeeping tab without having to click, in order to access it.  

Click on the tab _Housekeeping_ on the top of the screen:

You will see a panel with different filters. Here is how the screen is organized.  


###**Top Filters**  


- There are two different types of filters. The top ones need to be used to visualize or order the housekeeping list.  

The first filter, called _Housekeeping Status_ is multi-option filter, and you will need to use it to define what housekeeping statuses you wish to display:

- The middle filter, _Housekeeper_ is used to filter room by housekeepers and see what the workload is assigned to a certain employee. Upon first use, the list will be empty. This is because you will need to first **add housekeepers**. To do this, click on the link _Employee List_ on the left hand side of the panel:

- Another panel will pop up: fill in the details you deem important, and when finished click on the button _Save_ at the bottom of the page:

- To delete an employee, select the latter by checking the box on the left hand side of user name and click on the red button _Delete Selected Employees_:

The second row of filters are used to assign workload, change housekeeping status and assign priority.  

- The first filter, called _Assign Housekeeping Status_ displays all housekeeping statuses:

- The middle filter, tagged _Assign Housekeeper_ will be used to asign workload to any housekeeper configured. Note that there is always an _Unassigned_ option, which can be used to assign rooms that do not need employees work:

##**How to Assign the Daily Workload**  

- Start by choosing your preferred view by using the _Housekeeping View_ filter. In the exmaple below I am using the _View by Floor_ to display all of my hotel's daily housekeeping workload organized by floors:

- Notice that the system will always keep a count of the items displayed: the count of rooms is dynamic, meaning that if I choose to display only the Dirty Rooms, the number will remind only to how many Dirty room there are:
