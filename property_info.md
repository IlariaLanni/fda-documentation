Your Company Logo will appear in all system communication to your guests!  

##**Default Guest Settings**  

You can choose how the name of your guests is displayed on the Tape Chart and also their default country. The latter is a useful shortcut when making reservation, as it defaults the country of origin to a specific one, thus saving you some time! Remember that you can always edit the Country of Origin on a reservation basis.  

 - Click on the blue link **Default Guest Settings**, under section _Property Info_:
