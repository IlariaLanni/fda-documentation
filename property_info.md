As the name suggests, this section is dedicated to information about your company and how guest information are displayed in your system.  

## Logo Upload  

 In the Admin Settings, click on the link **Company Info** under section _Property Info_:  
 


![company_!.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/company_!.png)

 

 Click on the blue button _Upload Logo_ to upload one from your computer:  

![Property_Info_2.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Property_Info_2.png)




We recommend to upload a logo that is 300px x 100px.  
Your logo will appear on guest communications and on IBE.  



## Default Guest Settings  



You can choose how the name of your guests is displayed on the Tape Chart and also their default country. The latter is a useful shortcut when making reservation, as it defaults the country of origin to a specific one, thus saving you some time! Remember that you can always edit the Country of Origin on a reservation basis.  

 Click on the blue link **Default Guest Settings**, under section _Property Info_:
