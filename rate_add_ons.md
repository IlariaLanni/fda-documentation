#**Rate Add-Ons**

 - In the Admin Settings, click on the blue link **Rate Add-Ons** under section _Rates_:

 - Fill in all information: place the name (_Charge Title_), the price and the applicable tax/es, and select whether the charge is to be applied on a nightly or a reservation basis. For reporting purposes, select the right _Revenue Label_ from the scroll down menu, and click on the blue button _Save_ when done:
