#**Users**

Frontdesk Anywhere allows you to create as many users as you want, and as many access levels as you need. Although the login page will be the same for all users, you can limit what each can do and tailor-made what is displayed for each of them upon login.

##**User Levels**  

Creating different access levels for users may be necessary to protect certain sensitive information and to enable higher management to have an overrall access to the system. Levels are also used to limit what is displayed to a certain user when they log in into the account. Our first step will be to create the levels; once that is done, we will need to assign each user their respective access level.

 - In the Admin Settings, click on the blue link **User Levels** under section _Users_:

 - Your system comes with four defaulted, common access levels, that you can edit before creating new ones:

 - To **Edit** a User Level, click on the blue link _Edit_ on the right hand side of any level:  
 
 ![](4.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/4.png)  
 
 - Select all of the areas that you want accessible for the User Level you are editing. In the example below, I am editing the _All Access_ level and I am checking all boxes. This means that users I list under this level will have access to all of the checked areas of the system:

The tags next to the check boxes refer to the tabs that appear on the top of your Tape Chart:

 - To **Add** a User Level, click on the blue button _Add a New User Level_:  
 
 ![](8.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/8.png)  
 
 - Give a name for the new User Level and check all the applicable boxes. Whene done, click on the blue button _Save Changes_:  
 
 ![](9.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/9.png)  
 
 **Edit Permissions for a User Level**
 
 Now that you have created your User Levels, you can go more in depth and edit access permissions permissions within each level.
 
 - In the User Level List, click on the blue link _Permissions_:  
 
 ![](10.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/10.png)  
 
 - Select all the actions you want to enable for the level, by checking the boxes next to each tag. The latter describes the kind of action you can enable/disable:  
 
 ![](11.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/11.png)  
 
 - Once done, click on the blue button _Save Changes_ at the bottom of the page:  
 
 ![](13.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/13.png)  
 
 You can also duplicate a User Level, if you need to create a similar one by the one you just edited, by clicking on the blue button _Save and Duplicate User Level_.  
 
 - To **Delete** User Levels, select the box on the right hand side of any level you wish to erase, and click on the blue button _Delete Selected User Levels_:  
 
 ![](14.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/14.png)  
 
 - To **Deactivate** a User Level, simply uncheck the box on the right hand side of the User Levels List, under column _Status_:  
 
 ![](15.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/15.png)  
 
 
 **Create Users** 
 
 It is currently not possible to create users directly within your account: if you wish to create a new user, please contact our Support Team at support@frontdeskanywhere.com! 
 
 **Apply User Levels**  
 
 - All of your system users appear in the Users List. In the Admin Settings, click on the blue link **Users** under section _Users_:  
 
 ![](16.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/16.png) 

- You will see a list of all the currently created users: click on blue link _Edit_ on the right hand side of any user:  

![](17.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/17.png)  

- As mentioned above, it is not currenlty possible to create a user directly from your account, and for this reason the name, last name and username of each user is not editable; if you need to make any amendments to those fields, please contact our Support Team at support@frontdeskanywhere.com.
Select the right access level by using the scroll down menu next to the tag _User Type_:  

![](18.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/18.png)

- Choose the default view for the user, by selecting a choice from the drop down menu next to the tag _Default View_:  

![](19.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/19.png)  

- Click on the blue link _Save User_ at the bottom of the screen:  

![](20.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/20.png)  

- To **Deactivate** a user, un-check the box under column _Status_ on the right hand side of any user:  

![](21.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/21.png)

**Note**: it is currently not possible to delete a user! However, if a user has been made inactive there will be no chance of them accessing the system.

- If you have a lot of users, you might find it useful to filter them by level. You can do that by using the scroll down menu on the top right hand side of the screen:

**Shifts**

Setting up shifts is a useful tool for auditing and for checking operations that have been processed on a particular shift. You can also run reports for a particular shift to track back user activity!   

 - In the Admin Settings, click on the link **Shifts** under section _Users_:  
 
 ![](23.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/23.png)

- To start using shifts, you will need to change the Auditing Method from _Single Shift_ to _Multiple Shifts_, by using the scroll down menu:
