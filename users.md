#**Users**

Frontdesk Anywhere allows you to create as many users as you want, and as many access levels as you need. Although the login page will be the same for all users, you can limit what users can do and tailor-made what is displayed for each of them upon login.

###**User Levels**  

Creating different access levels for users may be necessary to protect certain sensitive information and to enable higher management to have an overrall access to the system. Levels are also used to limit what is displayed to a certain user when they log in into the account.  

 - In the Admin Settings, click on the blue link **User Levels** under section _Users_:

 - Your system comes with four defaulted and common access levels, that you can _Edit_ before creating new ones:

 - To edit a User Level, click on the blue link _Edit_ on the right hand side of any level:  
 
 ![](4.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/4.png)  
 
 - Select all of the areas you would like to enable for the User Level. In the example below, I am editing the _All Access_ level and I am checking all boxes. This means that users I will list under this level will have acces to all of the checked areas of the system:

The tags next to the check boxes refer to the tabs that appear on the top of your Tape Chart:
