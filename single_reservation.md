#**Single Reservation**  

You can create solo reservations easily with a simple click on the Tape Chart. You will need to make sure that the room you are trying to book for the chosen dates is available for the date range the reservation is for. 


1. ##**Choosing Dates and Showing Availability**  


The first way you can start creating a single reservation is by clicking directly on the empty box on your Tape Chart, corresponding to the day and room you want to book. 


 - Start by going to the _Frontdesk_ tab, upon login:

 - If the day you want to make the reservation for is not displaying on the Tape Chart, make sure to update the calendar accordingly, so that you will be able to visualize all availability for the requested date range:

Note that you can also use the View tabs on the top of your Tape Chart to make sure you have a good understanding of what is and is not available for the selected date range:

- Use the arrows on the top left corner of your Tape Chart, to see expand the Tape Chart and see what room is available for the selected period:

- Select the box corresponding to the room you want to book and the guest's arrival date; another window will pop-up:

That window is called **Reservation Folio**.
