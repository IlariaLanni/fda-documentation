summary: This section will guide you through the folio payment's section: from here you can record a payment, void or refund one, learn how to create invoice and how to transfer charges.  



##**The Payment Panel**  

 - The payment section is located on the right column of the folio, right under the summary of all charges, and it is accessible by clicking on the blue _Payment_ link:  

![payments_1.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/payments_1.png)  


 - Clicking on the link will bring up a pop up panel from where you can perform all operations related to payments:

The Payment panel can be separated into three main sections:     
 
 - The **Uninvoiced Transactions** drop down menu contains a list of all uninvoiced charges broken down by charge type and by date. You can visualize them by clicking on the small arrow on the left hand side of the tag _Uninvoiced Transactions_:  
 
 
![payments_3.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/payments_3.png)  

In the example above, you can see that the guest is being charged three Add-Ons items, one POS items and three Room Charges. 


 - The **Payments** drop down menu lists all payment operations and payment details successfully made for the folio:  


 ![payments_4.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/payments_4.png)


The **Total** field shows the total amount of payment received, while the **Balance** will show the remaining balance the guest owes.  


 - The **Payment Type** section is where you actually submit the payments:

##**Recording a Payment**

  - To record a payment, select the Payament Type by choosing the appropriate choice from the ones available in the drop down menu:    
  
  
![payments_6.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/payments_6.png)


- Fill in the _Cheque_ box with the check number, if you are recording a cheque payment, otherwise place the amount the guest is paying in the box on the left:   


![payments_7.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/payments_7.png)  


- If applicable, write down the recept number in the _Receipt Number_ box and a description in the box with the tag _Description_:  


![payments_8.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/payments_8.png)  


- To record the transaction as a pyament, click on the green button _Pay Now_:  


![payments_9.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/payments_9.png)


- You will see the message _Payment Successful_ once the action has been finalized. You will be able to see the payment details by clicking on the _Payments_ drop down menu:  


![payments_10.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/payments_10.png)



From that panel you can see the type of operation performed, the type of payment used, the date and time when the operation was successfully recorded in the system and the user that performed the action. The system will also show you the oustanding balance after the payment.    



- If your guest wants to pay for certain items only instead of a fixed amount, the system can calculate the sum of those items. Click on the scroll down _Uninvoiced Transactions_ to visualize all items on the guest's bill:  


![payments_15.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/payments_15.png)  


- Select the items the guest wishes to pay for by checking the box on the left hand side of each item:  


![payments_16.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/payments_16.png)  


Note that as items are being selected, the sum will change in the apposite field: in the example above, the guest is only paying for the additional items, for a total sum of $85. This comes very hand when the bill needs to be split among different people. However, note that **charges and corresponding payments are not linked in the system**: this means that invoices and reports won't record that a certain payment has been submitted for a certain charge.  


###**Payment Operations**  


- To perform operations on submitted payments, click on the Payments drop down menu, and under column _Type_ click on the green box _Payment_ for the payment you wish to perform your operations:  


![payments_21.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/payments_21.png)


**Convert to Deposit** will move the payment from being recorded as a payment proper and it will turn it into a Security Deposit.  
**Void** will annul the payment.  
**Refund** will enable you to refund part or the whole of the payment. If you wish to partially refund your guests, fill in the box with the amount you wish to refund and click on the box _Refund_.

  
  
###**Recording a Security Deposit**  


- You can record security deposits directly from the same Payment screen. Choose the Pay Type and insert the amount you want to have recorded as a deposit:  


![payments_11.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/payments_11.png)  


- Check the box with the tag _Take as Deposit_ and click on the button _Pay Now_:  


![payments_12.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/payments_12.png)  


- If you open the _Payments_ drop down menu, you will see that the sum is recorded in the system as a _Deposit_, and not under _Amount_:  


![payments_13.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/payments_13.png)
  


- In the folio screen, the amount submitted as deposit will appear in the field _Security Deposits_:  


![payments_14.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/payments_14.png)

  
  
###**Turning a Security Deposit into a Payment**  

- It might often happen that your guests will want to turn their security deposits into payments to set their bills. This is easily done! As a first thing, click on the _Payments_ scroll down menu:  


![payments_17.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/payments_17.png)  


- Under column _Type_, click on the box _Payment_ green box, corresponding to the security deposit:  

![payments_18.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/payments_18.png)  


- This will bring up information about the payment, and all possible operations that are available to perform:  


![payments_19.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/payments_19.png)   


 **Convert To Payment** will turn the security deposits into a payment.
 **Void** will annul the payment.  
 **Refund** will allow you to record a refund: note that there is an editable box next to the green button _Refund_ where you can choose the amount to refund:  
 
 
 
 ![payments_20.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/payments_20.png)  
 
 
 

###**Processing Payments with Payment Processing**  

If your account is integrated with a Payment Gateway, you will be able to _process_ payments for credit cards directly into the Payment screen.  

- To process a payment, click on the blue link _Payments_ in the folio, and select **Credit card** from the Payment Type drop down menu:  

![payments_22.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/payments_22.png)  


- Enter the credit card type from the _Card Type_ drop down menu. Note that if the guest has a credit card loaded in the folio, there will be an option to select that card:  


![payments_23.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/payments_23.png)  


In the case you select the existent card, all relevant fields will be automatically filled in; otherwise, you can select the card type and insert the card number and the expiration dates.  

- Place the amount you want to charge the guest:  

![payments_24.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/payments_24.png)  


- When Payment Gateway is active you will have the option to either charge the card, or authorize it:  


![payments_25.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/payments_25.png)



**Authorizing** the card will place a hold on the guest's card for the amount you selected.  
**Pay Now** will automatically charge the guest's card for the selected amount.  


- If you choose to authorize the card, you will receive a _Payment Successful_ message on the screen. You can open the Payments drop down menu to look up the authorization:  

![payments_26.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/payments_26.png)


As you can see from the example above, the amount corresponding to the Authorization appears in light grey, and the balance is not being affected by it.  

- If you click on the _Authorization_ blue button, you will be able to access the details and see the available actions that you can perform:  


![payments_27.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/payments_27.png)  


- If you need to release the authorized amount, simply click on the red button _Release_:  

![payments_28.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/payments_28.png)  


- If you want to capture the amount, or part of the authorized amount (held), insert the relevant value in the box and click on the blue button _Capture_:  

![payments_29.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/payments_29.png)  


 - You will see two options: to capture the chosen amount and retain the rest of the authorized amount (hold), click on the button _Capture and Retain_:  

![payments_30.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/payments_30.png)  


Note that the Authorized Amount will be, in this case, reduced by the amount captured. In the example above, the original amount authorized was $250, we have decided to capture $50 and retain the rest, so the current hold is of $200.  


- To capture the selected amount and release the rest of the authorized amount, click on the button _Capture and Release_:    

![payments_31.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/payments_31.png)
  
  
Note the _Authorization_ has disappeared, as we have released the held on the sum selected.
