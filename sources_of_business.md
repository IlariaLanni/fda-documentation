#**Sources of Business**  

Sources of Business track the origin of reservations. You can report on these in order to find out where people come to know about your property, or to check the production level for each channel.  
Each reservation that automatically arrives to your PMS comes with a _source tag_ that your system will pick up and store: you will need to organize these incoming sources via the set up of automatic rules that the system will follow. Before starting configuring those up, let's explore some system terminology that will come useful during the set up: 

**Source of Business Item**: this is the _source tag_ that identifies where a reservation comes from. These can be _Walk-In_, _Phone Call_, _Booking.com_, etc.  

**Source of Business Category**: categories are used to group together sources: you can think of them as "buckets" where different but affiliated sources are grouped together. For example, a Source Category can be _Direct_ and it can group all sources from direct bookings, as _EMail_, _Walk-In_, _Phone Calls_, etc.  

**Sources of Business Rules**: they are used to configure Source Items into Categories. They are the rules under which the ysstem will operate.
