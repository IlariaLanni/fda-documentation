#**Yield Management**  

The _Yield Management_ is a powerful tool of your PMS: it triggers automatic rate changes based on the occupancy level of a room type or run of house. The price change is governed by rules that you will have to place in the system, in order to define how the rates should change when certain conditions apply.  

##**Yield Management Rules**  

Let us start by defining what rules you want the system to follow.  

  - Click on the blue link **Yield Managament Rules** under section _Rates_:

  - Choose your conditions by selecting the relevant choices from the scroll down menus:
