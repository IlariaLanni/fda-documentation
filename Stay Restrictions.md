##**What Are Stay Restrictions**
  
  
Stay Restrictions is the place in your Frontdesk Anywhere account where you will be able to place minimum or maximum stay requirements and close outs.
These actions are all on rate level: for any configured rate, you can define a minimum stay lenght for guests booking it or prevent guests from booking that rate altogether.  


- In the _Admin Settings_, click on the link **Stay Restrictions** under section RATES:

##**Add Min/Max Stay Requirement**  


- To add a minimum stay restriction or to limit the amount of consecutive days guests can stay at your property, click on the blue button **Add Min/Max Requirement**:

 - Start inserting the information requested:

The _Description_ will appear on the booking engine as a guidance as to why guests cannot book, if their search does not meet the right criteria. Hence, we advise to keep the description straightforward, in order not to confuse your guests.  

If not sure about what days of the week the period corresponds to, select them all. The restriction will only pick up on the dates specified by the scroll down calendars.  


{{site.data.alerts.warning}}Important: restrictions work **inclusively**. This means that the restriction will be effective not only for the specific calendar/weekday you have chosen, but also for any reservation that includes those dates.  {{site.data.alerts.end}}  


Here is what this means: in the example above, I have set-up a minimum stay restriction of 2 nights for 12/22-26. The restriction will prevent guests from booking a one-night stay on those specific dates, but it will also prevent them from booking a one night stay on 12/21: this is because the check-out date would be 12/22, which is a day that is included in the restriction.  

If you want to allow a one night reservation for 12/21, then date 12/22 should not be included in the restriction.
