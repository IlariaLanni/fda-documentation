#**Tape Chart**  


The Tape Chart is a fundamental tool of your Frontdesk Anywhere account: it offers an overview of the property's current availability and rates and it allows you to make, modify, cancel and look up reservations in a fast and easy way. The Tape Chart will be a starting point for most front desk users, and there are a lot of ways to personalize it: here is a brief rundown of its functionalities!  


##**Availability**  

###**Displaying Availability**  


 - You can display the hotel's real time availability in different ways: on top of the Tape Chart, you will notice five different clickable tabs, each with a different time lenght:  


![tape_chart_1.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tape_chart_1.png)

  


 - Clicking on any of those tabs will bring your Tape Chart to show availability for the time lenght of your choice. In the example below, I have chosen to show all availability for 15 days:

 - The daily overall availability (run of house) will be shown next to the tag _All Availability_:

- The daily room type availability will be shown next to the room type names:

- To _expand_ the Tape Chart to display the available rooms under each type, you will simply need to click on the small arrow on the left hand side of the room type name:

- Likewise, to display all rooms available at the property, click on the small arrow on the left hand side of the written _All Availability_:

- Availability can also be organized and displayed around Floors, Class or a combination between them. On the left hand side of the Tape Chart, there is a drop down menu with the written _View By Type_:  

![tape_chart_7.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tape_chart_7.png)

 - Clicking on a different option in that drop down menu will update the Tape Chart to show availability accoding to your choice. In the example below, I picked the option _Floors_:
