#**Tape Chart**  


The Tape Chart is a fundamental tool of your Frontdesk Anywhere account: it offers an overview of the property's current availability and rates and it allows you to make, modify, cancel and look up reservations in a fast and easy way. The Tape Chart will be a starting point for most front desk users, and there are a lot of ways to personalize it: here is a brief rundown of its functionalities!

 - You can display the hotel's real time availability in different ways: on top of the Tape Chart, you will notice five different clickable tabs, each with a different time lenght:

 - Clicking on any of those tabs will bring your Tape Chart to show availability for the time lenght of your choice. In the example below, I have chosen to show all availability for 15 days:
