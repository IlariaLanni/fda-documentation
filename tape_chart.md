#**Tape Chart**  


The Tape Chart is a fundamental tool of your Frontdesk Anywhere account: it offers an overview of the property's current availability and rates and it allows you to make, modify, cancel and look up reservations in a fast and easy way. The Tape Chart will be a starting point for most front desk users, and there are a lot of ways to personalize it: here is a brief rundown of its functionalities!  


##**Displaying Availability**  

 - You can display the hotel's real time availability in different ways: on top of the Tape Chart, you will notice five different clickable tabs, each with a different time lenght:

 - Clicking on any of those tabs will bring your Tape Chart to show availability for the time lenght of your choice. In the example below, I have chosen to show all availability for 15 days:

 - You can easily see for what dates you are showing availability and what is the corresponding day of the week by looking at the first row on top of the Tape Chart:
