#**Tape Chart**  


The Tape Chart is a fundamental tool of your Frontdesk Anywhere account: it offers an overview of the property's current availability and rates and it allows you to make, modify, cancel and look up reservations in a fast and easy way. The Tape Chart will be a starting point for most front desk users, and there are a lot of ways to personalize it: here is a brief rundown of its functionalities!  


##**Displaying Availability**  


 - You can display the hotel's real time availability in different ways: on top of the Tape Chart, you will notice five different clickable tabs, each with a different time lenght:

 - Clicking on any of those tabs will bring your Tape Chart to show availability for the time lenght of your choice. In the example below, I have chosen to show all availability for 15 days:

 - The daily overall availability (run of house) will be shown next to the tag _All Availability_:

- The daily room type availability will be shown next to the room type names:

- To display the available rooms under each type, you will simply need to click on the small arrow on the left hand side of the room type name:

- Likewise, to display all rooms available at the property, click on the small arrow on the left hand side of the written _All Availability_:

- Availability can also be organized and displayed around Floors, Class or a combination between them. On the left hand side of the Tape Chart, there is a drop down menu with the written _View By Type_:

 - Clicking on a different option in that drop down menu will update the Tape Chart to show availability accoding to your choice. In the example below, I picked the option _Floors_:

- To expand the view to show each room, always click on the arrow on the left for each tag:
