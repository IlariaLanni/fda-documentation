#**Accounting**  

The Accounting section is about all of those settings that have to do payments and accounting. From here you can set up currency and accepted pay types and credit card types, number invoices, set up discount reasons and most importantly configure your Revenue Labels and Categories around which your reports are organized.  

##**Currency**  

During the intial system set-up it is important for you to configure the right currency, as this will be displayed in all guest communications and if applicable, on OBE.  

- Click on the blue link **Currency** under section _Accounting_:

**Note**: if your currency is not listed in the drop down menu, please contact our Support Team at support@frontdeskanywhere.com and ask them to have the currency added to your account!  

 - Choose whether to enable security deposits on your reservation folios by clicking on the relevant circle box.

Activating the security deposit will enable you to record payments as deposits rather than payments proper. When deposits are enabled, there will be track of them in each reservation folio:
