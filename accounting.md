#**Accounting**  

The Accounting section is about all of those settings that have to do payments and accounting. From here you can set up currency and accepted pay types and credit card types, number invoices, set up discount reasons and most importantly configure your Revenue Labels and Categories around which your reports are organized.  

##**Currency**  

During the intial system set-up it is important for you to configure the right currency, as this will be displayed in all guest communications and if applicable, on OBE.  

- Click on the blue link **Currency** under section _Accounting_:

- Select the right currency among the ones available in the scroll down menu:  

![](2.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/2.png)  

**Note**: if your currency is not listed in the drop down menu, please contact our Support Team at support@frontdeskanywhere.com and ask them to have the currency added to your account!  

 - Choose whether to enable security deposits on your reservation folios by clicking on the relevant circle box.

Activating the security deposit will enable you to record payments as deposits rather than payments proper. When deposits are enabled, there will be track of them in each reservation folio:

##**Fiscal Year**  

Each property has a different starting date for their Fiscal Year, depending on applicable governmental laws: for this reason we advise you to set this up during the intial configuration of your account.  

- Click on the blue link **Fiscal Year** under section _Accounting_:  

![](5.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/5.png)  

 - Select the month and the year of your fiscal year by following the format below: your current fiscal year is also displayed, in case you forgot!

 ##**Pay Types**  
 
 Selecting the pay types that are accepted at your property is important to avoid the margin of human error of your front desk staff when they collect payments, it is also good when auditing and run reports!  
 
 - In the Admin Settings, click on the blue link **Pay Types** under section _Accounting_:  
 
 ![](7.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/7.png)  
 
 - You will see a list of all the defaulted pay types enabled for your account:  
 
 ![](8.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/8.png)  
 
 - To **Add** a Pay Type, click on the blue button _Add a Pay Type_:  
 
 ![](9.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/9.png)  
 
 - A new row will appear along with an editable text box where you will need to insert the name of the new type of payment you want to add. Click on the button _Save_ when finished: 
 
 ![](10.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/10.png)  
 
 - To **Delete** a Pay Type, select it by checking the box on its left side and click on the blue button _Delete Selected Pay Types_:  
 
 ![](11.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/11.png)

##**Credit Card Types**

Along with Pay Types you can also configure all credit cards accepted at your property. Note that all accepted cards will show on your booking engine as available payment methods for your guests, and it is for this reason important to have them up to date.

- Click on the blue link **Credit Card types** under section _Accounting_:  

![](12.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/12.png)  

- You will see a list of all active credit card types that by default comes with your account:  

![](13.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/13.png)  

- To **Add** a credit card type, click on the blue button _Add a Card Type_: a new row will appear with an editable text box; insert the name for your card type and click on the blue button _Save Changes_:  

![](14.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/14.png)  

- To **Deactivate** a credit card type, uncheck the box under column status on the right hand side of the type you want to make inactive:

##**Payment Processing**  

Frontdesk Anywhere allows you to integrate with many secure payment gateways that will make charging a guest's card much faster and your check-in process much easier! 

**Note**: before starting, you will need to make sure to have enabled this feature in the system. Ask your Account Manager about it!

- In the Admin Settings, click on the link **Payment Processing** under section _Accounting_:  

![](17.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/17.png)  

- To add your Payment Gateway, click on the blue button _Add Payment Gateway_:  

![](19.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/19.png)

- Choose your gateway by looking it up among the ones in the list. Note that they are listed in alphabetic order! In my example below, I am chooseing Authorize.net:

![](20.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/20.png)  

- Scroll all the way down and go to the bottom of the page: name the gateway by editing the _Payment Gateway Label_ textbox. When done, enter the username and password for the gateway.

![](21.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/21.png)  

**Note**: the username and password should be provided to you by your Payment Gateway company.  

- When done, click on the blue button _Add Gateway_:  

![](22.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/22.png)  

- You will now be able to see the payment gateway:  

![](23.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/23.png)  

- All is left to do is enable the gateway on both/either the Frontdesk area and/or your Booking Engine. If the gateway is enabled on Frontdesk, you will be able to charge cards directly from the folios; making it active on the booking engine will enable automatic card charges when a guest finalizes a booking on your website:  

![](22.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/22.png)  

Remember to set up how you want to collect payments on your Booking Engine by setting up rules in section _OBOE_.

##**Credit Card Purge**

As a security measure Frontdesk Anywhere enables you to erase, on a regular basis, the details of your guestsâ€™ credit card stored in your account.  

 - In the Admin Settings, click on the blue link **Credit Card Purge** under section _Accounting_:  
 
 ![](24.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/24.png)  
 
 - Edit the textbox with a number by keeping in mind that all credit card stored for more than the time frame you set, will be automatically erased. Click _Save_ when finished:
 
 ![](![26.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/26.png)

- The system will run once a day and erase all credit card information stored in the system, for the time frame you set up: if you wish to manually do this process, click on the blue button _Purge Credit Card Numbers_:  

![](27.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/27.png)
