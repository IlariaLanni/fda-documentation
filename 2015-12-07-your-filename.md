#**Housekeeping**  

The Housekeeping section in your Frontdesk Anywhere helps you set up certain rules to govern the change in housekeeping status for each room at your property. This is necessary, in turn, to define what your Housekeeping Team will need to: in other words, you will be able to define in what occasions the system should report a certain room to be 'dirty' or 'clean', thus making it easier for the housekeepers to know what action is required of them!

##**Housekeeping Status**    

Housekeeping Statuses serve to indicate whether a certain room needs attention from your Housekeeping staff or not. Frontdesk Anywhere performs changes in the Housekeeping Status of each room thanks to certain Rules you will have to set up: since the rules are based on the Housekeeping Statuses, it will be good for you to familiarize with what each status mean!  

  - In the Admin Settings, click on the blue link **Housekeeping Statuses** under section _Housekeeping_:

  - You will see a list of available Housekeeping Statuses:

Here is a breakdown of what they mean:  

1. **Clean**: Room is clean and ready to be rented!  

2. **Inspect**: Room needs a formal inspection, where action from an Housekeeper might or not be necessary.  

3. **Dirty**: Room is currently rented but needs action from Houssekeepers.  

4. **Dirty Vacant**: Room is not currently rented, it needs full operations from housekeeping.  


**NOTE**: It is currently not possible to add or edit an Housekeeping Status.  


##**Housekeeping Rules**  

Housekeeping Rules are necessary to establish how the system should use the Housekeeping Status. Since the work of your Housekeeping staff will center on the Statuses, it is extremely important to set your rules correctly!  

 - In the Admin Settings, click on the blue link **Housekeeping Rules**, under section _Housekeeping_:

 - Your Frontdesk Anywhere comes with some very common default rules that define how your Housekeeping Statuses are to change:
