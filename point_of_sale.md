  If your property offers extra items for sale different from lodging charges,
  you can operate on those by using the POS (Point Of Sale) section. POS
  products are organized around POS Points and POS Categories. You can think of
  a POS Point as being, for example, a ‘restaurant’ or a ‘coffee shop’, a POS
  Category as being ‘food’ or ‘beverages’, and a POS Item as being ‘walnuts’ or
  ‘coffee’
