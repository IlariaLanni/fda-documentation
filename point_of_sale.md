#**POINT OF SALE**

If your property offers extra items for sale, separate from lodging charges, you can keep track of them by using the POS (Point Of Sale) section in the Admin Settings. POS items are organized on different levels, more specifically, into POS Points, POS Categories, and POS Items. This comes handy when you will run reports. You can think of a POS Point as being, for example, a ‘restaurant’ or a ‘coffee shop’, a POS Category as being ‘food’ or ‘beverages’, and a POS Item as being ‘walnuts’ or ‘coffee’.
